# Setup
Setup for the tp-link plug is pretty straight forward. You need to drop some configuration into your moonraker.cfg file, your printer.cfg file, and your macros.cfg file if you have one.

# moonraker.cfg
Add the below to your moonraker.cfg file. Make sure to add the IP of your tp-link plug to its field.
```
```

# printer.cfg
Add the below to your printer.cfg file. If you have a macros.cfg file, you can move the macros in there. Make sure that the idle_timeout stays in the printer.cfg file.
```
```
