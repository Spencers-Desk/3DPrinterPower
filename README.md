# 3DPrinterPower
This repository contains directions and configuration for controlling your 3D Printer's Power devices with Klipper. I created this while creating the YouTube video below. I'll likely add updates to this in the future when I begin using more powered devices.

The first powered device I setup was the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2. This was used to power off my printer 10 minutes after a print finished (giving adequate time to cool down). It also provides a few cool safety features which are laid out in more detail later on. In the future, I plan to add more power devices for air filtration, lighting, heated chamber, etc...
